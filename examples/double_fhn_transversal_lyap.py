"""
For instance, let’s interpret the system from `example` as two oscillators (which is what it is), one consisting of the first and second and one of the third and fourth component. Furthermore, let’s change the control parameters a bit to make the two oscillators identical. We can then calculate the transversal Lyapunov exponents to the synchronisation manifold as follows (important changes are highlighted):

Note that the initial state (line 17) is reduced in dimensionality and there is only one component for each synchronisation group.
